# CFPQ_Data

Graphs and grammars for experimental analysis of context free path querying algorithms.

## Prerequirements
* GCC
* Python 3

## How to start

Just install requirements and run init.py: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 init.py
```

The script downloads data (real-world RDF files) and [GTgraph](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/) --- a suite of synthetic graph generators.

## Repository structure

Graphs and grammars can be found in  ```data/graphs``` --- all graphs are divided into groups, which are placed in different directories. Each ```data/graphs/GroupName``` contains ```Matrices``` with graph descriptions and ```Grammars``` --- descriptions of queries. 

## Integration with graph DBs

We provide a set of scripts to simplify data loading into soe popular graph databases.

### RedisGraph

Data set can be loaded to RedisGraph with ```tools/redis-rdf```, for example:
```
python3 ./tools/redis-rdf/main.py --port [PORT] dir ./data/graphs/ScaleFree/Matrices/
```

### Neo4j

Work in progress.

## Data set

Set contains both real-world data and synthetic graphs for several specific cases; all graphs are represented in triples.
All graphs are represented in RDF format to unify loading process.

### RDFs

Real-world RDF files:

- Smaller graphs
  - a set of popular semantic web ontologies like **foaf**, **wine**, **pizza**.
- Bigger graphs
  - **geospecies** â€“ graph related to taxonomic hierarchy and geographical information of animal species
  - a set of graphs from the **Uniprot** protein sequences database

### Worst cases

Graphs with two cylces; the query is a grammar for the language of correct bracket sequences.

### Sparse graphs 

Graphs generated with [GTgraph](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/) to emulate sparse data.
